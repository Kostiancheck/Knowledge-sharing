# Knowledge-sharing

Kanban board Notion link: https://www.notion.so/Knowledge-sharing-e4805256fd4647e09ee8fbb51372cc7f

To add notes/code for your tech talk:

1. select corresponding top-level folder (databases, programming, other, etc)
2. create sub-folder with the name of your tech talk topic from Notion
3. add your files and (optionally) README.md

If you want to add `md` files from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) please consider that all attached images
are in the `images` sub-folder. Example: [images sub-folder in Hash Table](./programming/Hash%20Table/images)

To make Obsidian save attachments to `images` sub-folder go to  `Settings` -> `Files and links` ->
Set `Default location for new attachments` to `In subfolder under current folder` and `Subfolder name` to `images`
