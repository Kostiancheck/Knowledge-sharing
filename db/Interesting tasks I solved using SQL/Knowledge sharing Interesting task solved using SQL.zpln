The ruling notes that the street artist explicitly stated that the public is morally and legally free to reproduce, amend, and otherwise use any copyright works.\tFollowing Banksy\u0027s own MO, Full Colour Black claimed that the art is a work of graffiti sprayed in a public placeand EUIPO agreed. It was free to be photographed by the general public and has been disseminated widely, the ruling states. Banksy permitted parties to disseminate his work and even provided high-resolution versions of his work on his website and invited the public to download them and produce their own items.\tBy choosing to be anonymous, the court found that he would be unable to protect this piece of art under copyright laws without identifying himself. In effect, this decision by the EU could have serious ramifications for the artist, because if he chooses to remain anonymous, his other trademarks could be voided too.I like the Work of Banksy but its his failure and he strongly forced a situation like this.Edit: there is a newer ruling from 2022 ruled in the UK that says Banksy can keep his copyright. I wonder how this affects the higher EU curt ruling.|▁Full▁Colour▁Black|full colour black|\n|\tDune focuses more on its universe and world-building than on any of its charactersThis right here I cannot fault you, but it illustrates that you have not read the source novel. You are right in that it spends more time worldbuilding than character building, but so does the book. Im not defending it from a storytelling standpoint, rather putting into perspective Herberts view when he wrote it The world is a character More important than Paul et alDune is *dense*, which is one reason why it has endured But is also why works adapted from its themes have been much more commercially successful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |▁Paul▁et▁alDune   |paul et aldune   |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+-----------------+\nonly showing top 20 rows\n\n"
