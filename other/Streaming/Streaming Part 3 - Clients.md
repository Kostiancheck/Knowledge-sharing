IKD. Browser?

h.264 and h.265 are proprietary algorithms. h.264 is old and widely supported. h.265 is not. It will be a PITA to make h.265 work in browser.

AV1 is great but requires hardware decoder. For Safari it means you need to have iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 and later. For Windows it means you need NVidia 40 series and later.
