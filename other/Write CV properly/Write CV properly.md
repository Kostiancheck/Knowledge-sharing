# Intro

You must understand that CV is a matter of taste: what some recruiters enjoy other hates. Also, we are not designers, UI/UX guys, or illustrators, so for us - regular programmers - the rule of thumb is to create something informative, laconic, and **NOT UGLY**.

Because a resume is a matter of taste I will exclude some shit like ‚Äúinterests section‚Äù and other stuff I don‚Äôt like from this discussion.

# Resume Formats

First of all, choose the overall format/template for your resume. 

1. **[Chronological Format](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/chronological-resume-tips-and-examples)**
The most popular solution, a good option if you have a rich professional work history with no gaps in employment. The main part of the resume is your professional and educational history
2. [Functional Format](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/functional-resume-tips-and-examples)
The format emphasizes the skills section and is a good option if you are switching industries or have some gaps in your work history. The main part of the resume is your skills and how you applied them
3. [Combination Format](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/combination-resume-tips-and-examples)
The format emphasizes both skills and accomplishments, and recent work history. Good for small job experience and college graduate with minimal work experience

# What to add to your resume

Every resume should include the next parts:

1. Name and contact information
Your resume should begin with your name and contact information, including your email address and phone number. Your name should be highly visible at the top of your resume with a bolded or larger font than the rest of the document.
2. [Summary or objective](https://www.notion.so/Write-CV-properly-7d1ff896ec274ed68d8dba51a254010c?pvs=21)
3. [Professional history](https://www.notion.so/Write-CV-properly-7d1ff896ec274ed68d8dba51a254010c?pvs=21)
4. [Educational history](https://www.notion.so/Write-CV-properly-7d1ff896ec274ed68d8dba51a254010c?pvs=21)
5. [Skills and abilities](https://www.notion.so/Write-CV-properly-7d1ff896ec274ed68d8dba51a254010c?pvs=21)
6. (Optional) Certificates, Awards, Publications

## Summary and objective

[https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/resume-summary-examples](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/resume-summary-examples)

An objective statement quickly explains your¬†[career goals](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/setting-goals-to-improve-your-career)¬†and is a good choice for those with limited professional experience, such as recent college or high school graduates. A resume summary is a short statement that uses¬†[active language](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/action-verbs-to-make-your-resume-stand-out)¬†to describe your relevant work experience and skills. 

Some rules about summary

- Place your resume summary under contact information (at the top of the page)
- A well-written resume summary is brief ‚Äî between two to three sentences
- It should include your years of professional experience, top skills, strengths, accomplishments, and what you're looking for in your next role
- Use adjectives
Don't use general adjectives like ‚Äúsmart‚Äù or superlatives like ‚Äúbest‚Äù. Some examples: ‚Äúseasoned,‚Äù ‚Äúinnovated,‚Äù ‚Äúversatile,‚Äù ‚Äúadaptable‚Äù and ‚Äúqualified‚Äù, ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù

How to write summary

- Write your most important experiences and skills
- Review the job description of the position you're applying for and check what of your skills fit it
- Put together a two to three-sentence summary that briefly showcases those skills
- Ask Chat GPT to write summary for u based on job description and your experience

Some people choose to use sentences, while others prefer bullet points. Both formats are useful for explaining traits or qualifications.

## Professional History

Write your professional history section in reverse-chronological order. Start with your most recent job and provide a short description, including the company name, time period in which you were employed, your job title and a few key achievements during your time at the company.

When listing your professional history, you should keep a few best practices in mind:

- **Use numbers to measure your impact, when possible.**¬†Including specific numerical achievements can help employers understand your direct potential value to their company.
    
    > *Examples: ‚ÄúDeveloped new process for requesting supplies, reducing fulfillment time by 10%.‚Äù
    ‚ÄùSaved up to 2000$ per month moving ETL from batch to streaming processing‚Äù*
    > 
- **Use keywords¬†from the job description.**¬†Similar to your skills section, you should also include information from the job description in your job history bullets.
- **Use action verbs.**¬†Make a stronger impact by using¬†[action verbs](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/resume-power-words)¬†(yes Indeed has a list of action verbs for the resume, they are crazy) to describe your professional achievements. Some examples include ‚Äú*developed*,‚Äù ‚Äú*saved,*‚Äù ‚Äú*drove*‚Äù and ‚Äú*managed*.‚Äù
- **List achievements and responsibilities**. Some articles says to list achievements instead of responsibilities, but I don‚Äôt agree

But golden rule that can sum-up everything above is to write STORIES. Everyone love a good story, especially recruiters. You professional history must show you progression over jobs, what you have archived on each job, what you were dealing with, what was your impact. Each ‚Äústory‚Äù can show how you understood business problem, solved it using hard skills and collaborated or delivered the solution using soft skills.

## Educational History

Write as much as you can if you have no professional experience ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If you do simply list your relevant education

> Example:
> 
> 
> ***Atlanta Graduate School of Management | Atlanta, GA***
> 
> *Master‚Äôs of Business Administration (MBA)*
> 
> *Master‚Äôs of Science in Information Systems (MSIS)*
> 

## Skills

There are 3 types of skills

### ****Technical (hard) skills****

Just write programming languages, frameworks and tools you are using and that are relevant to job description.

### Soft skills

[https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/soft-skills](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/soft-skills)

Soft skills are personality traits and behaviors that help you to work well with other people and develop your career. It can be a big deal for managers, PP, HR, etc but for programmers good enough would be to show that you are not an idiot (or at least not so big idiot)

But if you want you can show that you have experience in writing (documentation, requirements), public speaking (presenting results to stakeholders, speaker on conferences), mentoring etc.  

### ****Transferable Skills****

Some bullshit. It just soft and hard from previous experience that can be used on your new job.

# Tools and templates

There are a lot of templates and tools for resumes. You can create it from scratch in Word/Google Docs, you can import it from Linkedin, you can create it using specific tools

# Final tips

Format your resume, make it nice and easy to read. 

- TRY TO FIT EVERYTHING ON THE SINGLE PAGE
    - The best resumes are 1 page in length. Whether you‚Äôre an experienced CEO with 20 years of experience, or an intern looking for your first job, you should always try to keep your resume to the 1-page max.
- Length should be about 500 - 600 words
- **Use PDF file format**
- Make your font between 10 and 12 point size.
- Select a font that is clean and easy to read like Arial or Helvetica; avoid stylized fonts.
- Make sure your margins are 1 to 1.5 inches.
- Make your name and section headers bold or slightly bigger in font size (no more than 14 points).
- Use bullet points when listing several different pieces of information, like under your education and professional history sections.
- Check spelling
- Remove cliches and buzzwords from resume. Recruiters are sick of them, so just google list of buzzwords and remove them. BUT sometimes buzzwords can be useful to path automotive resume search engines

<aside>
‚ùó Update your resume for each position. For each job, update summary and adjust the keywords in the skills section so that it‚Äôs a great fit for what the employer needs. You should also change what you emphasize in the professional history and educational experiences sections depending on what‚Äôs listed in the job description.

# Answer generated by Notion AI

Writing a resume can be a challenging task, especially if you are unsure of what to include or how to format it. Here are some tips on how to write a resume properly:

1. Tailor your resume to the job you are applying for: Review the job posting and make sure that your resume highlights the skills and experiences that are most relevant to the position.
2. Use a clear and easy-to-read format: Use bullet points, headings, and white space to make your resume easy to scan. Choose a font that is easy to read, such as Arial or Times New Roman.
3. Keep it concise: Your resume should be no longer than two pages. Include only the most important and relevant information.
4. Use action words: Use strong action words to describe your accomplishments and responsibilities. For example, instead of saying "responsible for managing a team," say "successfully managed a team of 10 employees."
5. Highlight your accomplishments: Instead of just listing your responsibilities, highlight your accomplishments and the results you achieved. For example, instead of saying "increased sales," say "increased sales by 25% in the first quarter."
6. Include relevant keywords: Many companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen resumes. Include relevant keywords in your resume to ensure that it gets past the ATS and is seen by a human.
7. Proofread: Make sure to proofread your resume for spelling and grammar errors. Have someone else read it over as well to catch any mistakes you might have missed.

By following these tips, you can create a resume that is informative, concise, and visually appealing. Remember, your resume is your first impression with a potential employer, so make it count!
