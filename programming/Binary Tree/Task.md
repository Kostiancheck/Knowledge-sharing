## Task
1. Read list of unique integers from `integers.txt`. They are comma-separated. 
2. Create a balanced binary search tree where each node will represent a integer from the list.
3. Write a function to retrieve any given integer from balanced binary search tree. Return None if not found.
4. Read list of test integers from `test.txt`. They are comma-separated and contain best-case, worst-case, 25th, 50th, 75th percentile and 3 random integers. Measure retrieval function performance VS for loop on unsorted list for given test integers.
